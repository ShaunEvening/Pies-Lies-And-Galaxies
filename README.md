<h1 align="center">PIES, LIES, AND GALAXIES </h1>

Inspired by the riddle of the truth teller and the lair, we have set out to model the old brainteaser in a fun and modern way... with space and pie!

Pies, lies, and galaxies offers a simple interface with an 8-bit style to interact with our friends Zip and Zap. These two fine spacey gentleman run an intergalactic diner that offer it's patrons 2 different slices of pie. One slice offer the one who consumes it life eternal, the other slice will plague who ever eats it with mild discomfort for the rest of their days.
